        "In our Introduction, we review our overall topic of Anime recommendations as well as why Anime recommendations is significant. We also go over various questions that will be tackled by the rest of the project. For our Method, we discuss the existing datasets we found through Kaggle and the feature variables and target variable we decided to work with. We also decided that we will consider k Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes as machine learning algorithms. In Results, we perform data cleaning and wrangling so that the data can be analyzed, as well as split our data into testing and training sets to do further analysis. We also provide visualizations of our data. For the Discussion portion of this project, we compare the results we found by using the three machine learning algorithms, as results after hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. We also consider any ethical implications and future work we are interested in with this project in general.\n"

        "\n",
        "Anime viewers need better recommendations now that streaming platforms have become increasingly popular due to COVID-19 and quarantining policies. This can be done if there were a way to predict how a user would feel about an anime based on their previous reviews on other animes. Our project is to determine the score a user would give an anime based on multiple factors based on the previous ratings they have given, or rather, how much a user would like a certain anime they have not yet seen. Our results may vary if the target user's available data is too widespread, or if the amount of data given to the system is too small. Through this project, we want to learn how we could predict a user's anime rating based on previous data about the animes they have watched.\n",

        "\n",
        "In times of COVID-19, the use of streaming services has become widespread as more and more people seek out entertainment from their homes. In particular, aspects of Japanese culture like anime and manga have gotten more popular thanks to social media apps like Tiktok making these topics skyrocket in popularity. With that in mind, finding the next series or movie to watch is an issue we want to tackle in our project. Insights from this project can help us predict how a user would feel about an anime based on multiple factors, which can be used in turn to support a recommendation system for users.\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4><b>Questions</b></h4>\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the aforementioned problem and its importance, we set out to tackle the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Can we predict a user’s ratings for an anime based on some characteristics of the user and the anime series?**\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Can we predict a user’s ratings for an anime based on their birthday and the anime’s genre?**\n",
        "\n",
        "These two questions take into account features such as the user's birthday and the anime in question's genre. The user's birthday corresponds to their age, which we can deduce from the year their birthdate is in. Using this data, we will determine if there is correlation between a user's age, and the anime's genre. We want to see if, in general, an older population is more drawn to a certain genre compared a younger population.\n",
        "\n",
        "><b>Would k Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, or Gaussian Naive Bayes be more effective in predicting the score a user would rate an anime based on the user's age and gender and the anime series's popularity, number of episodes and rank?</b>\n",
        "\n",
        "This question aims to compare the effectiveness and accuracies of various machine learning algorithms in predicting/classifying our target variable (overall score) from our feature variables. By using these algorithms on our data, we will be able to tell numerically which is more effective."

        "Our data was obtained via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/marlesson/myanimelist-dataset-animes-profiles-reviews) (if URL doesn't show: https://www.kaggle.com/marlesson/myanimelist-dataset-animes-profiles-reviews). The original dataset had 3 different spreadsheets containing information on MyAnimeList listings - one for anime, one for user profiles, and one for user reviews. We ended up merging the 3 datasets together to create one continuous spreadsheet.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the anime spreadsheet, the data had the following variables: anime ID, title, its synopsis, its genres, whether it had finished airing, # of episodes, # of users who had watched it, its popularity and ranking, overall score, an image URL for the anime, and a link to its listing on MyAnimeList. For the purpose of this project, we disregarded the last 2 columns potential feature variables. This spreadsheet essentially contained information about all the anime listed on MyAnimeList.\n",
        "\n",
        "The user profile spreadsheet had 5 columns for user profiles: their username, gender, birthday, favorite anime, and a link to their profile. For the purpose of this project, we disregarded profile links. This spreadsheet helps us connect users tracking anime on MyAnimeList to the anime they enjoyed the most, providing the basis of what we eventually plan to use the data for - determining whether a given user would enjoy a given anime.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the anime reviews spreadsheet had 7 columns: review ID, reviewer, anime ID, the review itself, the overall score (out of 10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest), score breakdown (1-10, factoring in the overall rating, story, animation, sound, character, and user enjoyment), and a link to the review. For the purpose of this project, we disregarded the last column. The review spreadsheet provides a further breakdown in order to help us gain insight into users' tastes - using our anime spreadsheet, we can now see what parts of an anime a user likes as well as detect any trends within a user's ratings to discern if they have a specific preference for a certain anime genre.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we combined all 3, the final dataset that we used for our project ended up having 10 feature variables and 2 target variables. Our feature variables were user profile/birthday/gender/favorites and an anime's ID/title/genre/episode count/popularity/ranking. Our outcome variables were the categorical scores that a user gave to a given anime, and the overall score they subsequently gave. This single CSV file had over 75000 rows.\n",

From user data, we can figure out if there is a certain genre that a user enjoys, or if there is a certain age or gender group among MyAnimeList users that will tend to enjoy an anime more than other users who do not fall into this group. Similarly, with the feature variables that have to do with an anime also serve as important predictors. We can determine if shorter/longer anime have higher or lower reviews, and the popularity/ranking on MyAnimeList can reveal trends in how a user decides what anime to watch next. Similarly, one genre may have higher rankings overall because it is less niche and caters to a broader demographic. The title of an anime can also provide a connection to increased viewership and rating if the anime is part of a series that spans multiple seasons.\n",

        "    data exist in close proximity, essentially, birds of a feather flock together. kNN looks at all the specific points closest to the supplied point to predict, and counts the \"votes\" for the classification that appears the most. Since our data is not sparse, it is reasonable to assume that it would work well with our dataset since it would help us classify a supplied point and there is a lot of data to work with, hence ensuring an accurate classification with the calculated predictors and patterns within the data. </br>\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   **Decision Tree**\n",
        "    <br>Decision trees assume that the entire training set is the \"root\" at the start of the tree/algorithm, and proceeds to categorize data in the set based on \"tests\" of whether data has a specific attribute or not. With 10 feature variables, we would be able to classify each data point easily because of the in-depth features we are using for the training set. Any nodes with similar attributes would be placed together. The algorithm would learn based on the decisions/categories the algorithm has made and subsequently be able to predict how well a new anime show would fare in terms of user review.</br>\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   **Naive Bayes**\n",
        "    <br>Naive Bayes operates under the assumption that all features are equally prioritized in the classification system and all features are statistically independent. Subsequently, the algorithm uses probabilistic classifiers to partition the data; thus, similar points end up in the same classifier. Based on the probability that a supplied data point to predict falls into a certain category, we can predict which category that a new data point would fall into. Since we have many data points that share similar values in terms of one (or more) of our feature variables, using Naive Bayes would help us split the data up into groups of data points that are similar to one another.</br>\n"

        "  For our data, we used 3 algorithms in order to compare the results of each one: k Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes. Before testing classifiers, we first used One Hot Encoding to make our categorical variables easier to manipulate and Standard Scaler to standardize feature variables during data wrangling. On our first attempt, we used the classifiers alongside preliminary training/testing data without hyperparameter tuning. Our results yielded seemingly low accuracy and F1 scores. \n",
        "\n",
        "  Following our original attempt, we used recursive feature selection to see if only a subset of feature variables was enough to optimize algorithm performance. Because of this, we could only use non-encoded variables, which ended up being age, episode, rank, and popularity; after feature selection was finished, all features except episode count were chosen as the selected features. We redid the model training and testing and our results yielded similar numbers to our results sans feature selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Out of the 3 algorithms we used, we proceeded to perform hyperparameter tuning on decision trees and Naive Bayes to avoid overfitting our data. We disregarded k Nearest Neighbors as its accuracy score was lower than those of the former two. Between the two, the best algorithm to use would be a decision tree with tuned parameters. These parameters would be max_depth and max_leaf_nodes, both with values of 100. Upon testing our tuned algorithms with the testing set, this confirmed that a Decision Tree would be the best algorithm to use. Our testing set score with the best parameters had a corresponding value of about 0.23. Thus, the decision tree algorithm proved to be the best one for our data. \n",
        "\n",
        "  From our findings, however, even with a decision tree algorithm, the scores from grid search on the test data were still very low, with our best score only slightly less than 0.24. Thus, with a decision tree algorithm, even when we factor in only 4 non-encoded variables, the performance would not be very high. So while values for our outcome variables *could* be identified, they would likely not be ideal values and have a very high risk of inaccuracy. However, our model did show improvement after hyperparameter tuning, which leaves room for further improvement.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ethically, our project's results should not be accepted at face value, simply because there is not much correlation between the features and the target variable. Also, the information from our data source was provided by users who may not have been 100% truthful with their inputs. Therefore, the data may not be as accurate. The introduction of human bias into our data means that there are too many outside factors that have influenced the dataset we used. For future work, it would be interesting to use even more features for our data to continue seeing if there is correlations between these features and our target variable, the overall score. It would also be very interesting if we were to find a certain correlation to actually predict animes that users would want to watch and have it displayed in some sort of user interface such as an app."
